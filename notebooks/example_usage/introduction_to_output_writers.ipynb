    "# Introduction to the terrainbento output writers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial shows example usage of the terrainbento boundary handlers. For comprehensive information about all options and defaults, refer to the [documentation](http://terrainbento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you have at least skimmed the [terrainbento manuscript](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/1267/2019/) and worked through the [Introduction to terrainbento](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/example_usage/Introduction_to_terrainbento.ipynb) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### terrainbento output writers\n",
    "\n",
    "By default terrainbento will save a [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) file at equal intervals specified by the ``output_interval`` parameter. For many applications it may be sufficient to run a model, save output, and then open the stack of NetCDFs for postprocessing (we recommend [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) and [holoviews](http://holoviews.org) for opening, analyzing, and plotting stacks of NetCDFs in python). \n",
    "\n",
    "If in your application, you want to have additional output written at the ``output_interval`` intervals, you can pass any number of functions or classes that write this ouput to terrainbento. These functions and classes are called **output writers**. There is no limit to what you can do with the output writers. You could use them to make plots to turn into an animation, write diagnostic information about model run time, or calculate an objective function value over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the output writers support as many possible use cases, terrainbento was designed to take any number of functions or classes as output writers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference material\n",
    "If you are not familiar with user defined python functions, consider reviewing [this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/functions-python-tutorial#udf).

    "**The links to other notebooks will not work on GitHub. To use them you'll need to clone this repository and open the notebooks using [`jupyter notebook`](https://jupyter.org).**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are three additional introductory tutorials: \n",

    "    1) [Introduction terrainbento](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/notebooks/example_usage/Introduction_to_terrainbento.ipynb) \n",

    "    \n",
    "    3) **This Notebook**: [Introduction to output writers in terrainbento](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/notebooks/example_usage/introduction_to_output_writers.ipynb). \n",

    "    1) [Basic](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_basic_steady_solution.ipynb) the simplest landscape evolution model in the terrainbento package.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) [BasicVm](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_basic_var_m_steady_solution.ipynb) which permits the drainage area exponent to change\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) [BasicCh](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_basicCh_steady_solution.ipynb) which uses a non-linear hillslope erosion and transport law\n",
    "\n",
    "    4) [BasicVs](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_basicVs_steady_solution.ipynb) which uses variable source area hydrology\n",
    "\n",
    "    5) [BasisRt](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_basicRt_steady_solution.ipynb) which allows for two lithologies with different K values"
