Section 1: Distribution Description
Scale Factor: 0.6646393004594834
Shape Factor: 0.6
Intermittency Factor: 0.1
Number of wet days per year: 37

The scale factor that describes this distribution is calculated based on a
provided value for the mean wet day rainfall.
This provided value was:
1.0


Section 2: Theoretical Predictions
Based on the analytical form of the wet day rainfall distribution, we can
calculate theoretical predictions of the daily rainfall amounts associated with
N-year events.
Expected value for the wet day total of the 10.0 year event is: 12.853
Expected value for the wet day total of the 25.0 year event is: 16.34
Expected value for the wet day total of the 100.0 year event is: 22.235


Section 3: Predicted 95% confidence bounds on the exceedance values based on
number of samples drawn.
The ability to empirically estimate the rainfall associated with an N-year event
depends on the probability of that event occurring and the number of draws from
the probability distribution. The ability to estimate increases with an
increasing number of samples and decreases with decreasing probability of event
occurrence.
Exceedance values calculated from 1000 draws from the daily-rainfall probability
distribution. This corresponds to 27 effective years.

For the given number of samples, the 95% confidence bounds for the following
event return intervals are as follows:
Expected range for the wet day total of the 10.0 year event is: (8.338, 17.368)
Expected range for the wet day total of the 25.0 year event is: (8.476, 24.205)
Expected range for the wet day total of the 100.0 year event is: (4.436, 40.034)


Section 4: Empirical Values
These empirical values should be interpreted in the context of the expected
ranges printed in Section 3. If the expected range is large, consider using a
longer record of rainfall. The empirical values should fall within the expected
range at a 95% confidence level.
Estimated value for the wet day total of the 10.0 year event is: 10.161
Estimated value for the wet day total of the 25.0 year event is: 13.49
Estimated value for the wet day total of the 100.0 year event is: 14.602
