class StochasticErosionModel(ErosionModel):
    """Base class for stochastic-precipitation terrainbento models.

    A **StochasticErosionModel** inherits from
    :py:class:`ErosionModel` and provides functionality needed by all
    stochastic-precipitation models.

    This is a base class that handles processes related to the generation of
    preciptiation events.

    Two primary options are avaliable for the stochastic erosion models. When
    ``opt_stochastic_duration=True`` the model will use the
    `PrecipitationDistribution <https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/components/uniform_precip.html>`_
    Landlab component to generate a random storm duration, interstorm duration,
    and precipitation intensity or storm depth from an exponential
    distribution. When this option is selected, the following parameters are
    used:

        - mean_storm_duration
        - mean_interstorm_duration
        - mean_storm_depth

    When ``opt_stochastic_duration==False`` the model will have uniform
    timesteps but generate rainfall from a stretched exponential distribution.
    The duration indicated by the parameter ``step`` will first be split into a
    series of sub-timesteps based on the parameter
    ``number_of_sub_time_steps``, and then each of these sub-timesteps will
    experience a duration of rain and no-rain based on the value of
    ``rainfall_intermittency_factor``. The duration of rain and no-rain will
    not change, but the intensity of rain will vary based on a stretched
    exponential distribution described by the shape factor
    ``rainfall__shape_factor`` and with a scale factor calculated so that the
    mean of the distribution has the value given by ``rainfall__mean_rate``.

    The following parameters are used:

        - rainfall__shape_factor
        - number_of_sub_time_steps
        - rainfall_intermittency_factor
        - rainfall__mean_rate

    The hydrology uses calculation of drainage area using the user-specified
    routing method. It then performs one of two options, depending on the
    user's choice of ``opt_stochastic_duration`` (True or False).

    If the user requests stochastic duration, the model iterates through a sequence
    of storm and interstorm periods. Storm depth is drawn at random from a gamma
    distribution, and storm duration from an exponential distribution; storm
    intensity is then depth divided by duration. This sequencing is implemented by
    overriding the run_for method.

    If the user does not request stochastic duration (indicated by setting
    ``opt_stochastic_duration`` to ``False``), then the default
    (**erosion_model** base class) **run_for** method is used. Whenever
    **run_one_step** is called, storm intensity is generated at random from an
    exponential distribution with mean given by the parameter
    ``rainfall__mean_rate``. The stream power component is run for only a
    fraction of the time step duration step, as specified by the parameter
    ``rainfall_intermittency_factor``. For example, if ``step`` is 10 years and
    the intermittency factor is 0.25, then the stream power component is run
    for only 2.5 years.

    In either case, given a storm precipitation intensity :math:`P`, the runoff
    production rate :math:`R` [L/T] is calculated using:

    .. math::

        R = P - I (1 - \exp ( -P / I ))

    where :math:`I` is the soil infiltration capacity. At the sub-grid scale, soil
    infiltration capacity is assumed to have an exponential distribution of which
    :math:`I` is the mean. Hence, there are always some spots within any given grid cell
    that will generate runoff. This approach yields a smooth transition from
    near-zero runoff (when :math:`I>>P`) to :math:`R \\approx P`
    (when :math:`P>>I`), without a "hard threshold."

    The following at-node fields must be specified in the grid:
