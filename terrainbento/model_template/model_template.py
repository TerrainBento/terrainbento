        Examples
        --------
        This is where you can make code examples showing how to use the model
        you created. Here we typically put a very short example that shows a
        minimally complete parameter dictionary for creating an instance of the
        model.

        Then in unit tests we include all possible analytical solutions and
        assertion tests needed to verify the model program is working as
        expected.

        *For example*: This is a minimal example to demonstrate how to
        construct an instance of model **ModelTemplate**. Note that a YAML
        input file can be used instead of a parameter dictionary. For more
        detailed examples, including steady-state test examples, see the
        terrainbento tutorials.

        To begin, import the model class.

        >>> from terrainbento.model_template import ModelTemplate

        >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
        >>> from landlab.values import random
        >>> from terrainbento import Clock, BasicStVs
        >>> clock = Clock(start=0, stop=100, step=1)
        >>> grid = RasterModelGrid((5,5))
        >>> _ = random(grid, "topographic__elevation")

        Construct the model.

        >>> model = ModelTemplate(clock, grid)
