    r"""**BasicRtSa** model program.

    This model program combines the :py:class:`BasicRt` and :py:class:`BasicSa`
    programs by allowing for two lithologies, an "upper" layer and a "lower"
    layer and explicitly resolving a soil layer. This soil layer is produced by
    weathering that decays exponentially with soil thickness and hillslope
    transport is soil-depth dependent. Given a spatially varying contact zone
    elevation, :math:`\eta_C(x,y))`, a spatially varying soil thickness
    :math:`H` and a spatially varying bedrock elevation :math:`\eta_b`,
    model **BasicRtSa** evolves a topographic surface described by :math:`\eta`
    with the following governing equations:

    .. math::

        \eta = \eta_b + H

        \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = P_0 \exp (-H/H_s)
                                        - \delta (H) K Q^{m} S^{n}
                                        - \nabla q_h

        \frac{\partial \eta_b}{\partial t} = -P_0 \exp (-H/H_s)
                                             - (1 - \delta (H) ) K Q^{m} S^{n}

        q_h = -D H^* \left[1-\exp \left( -\frac{H}{H_0} \right) \right] \nabla \eta

        K(\eta, \eta_C ) = w K_1 + (1 - w) K_2

        w = \frac{1}{1+\exp \left( -\frac{(\eta -\eta_C )}{W_c}\right)}

    where :math:`Q` is the local stream discharge, :math:`S` is the local
    slope, :math:`m` and :math:`n` are the discharge and slope exponent
    parameters, :math:`W_c` is the contact-zone width, :math:`K_1` and
    :math:`K_2` are the erodabilities of the upper and lower lithologies, and
    :math:`D` is the regolith transport parameter. :math:`w` is a weight used
    to calculate the effective erodibility :math:`K(\eta, \eta_C)` based on the
    depth to the contact zone and the width of the contact zone. :math:`H_s` is
    the sediment production decay depth, :math:`H_0` is the sediment transport
    decay depth, :math:`P_0` is the maximum sediment production rate, and
    :math:`H_0` is the sediment transport decay depth. :math:`q_h` is the
    hillslope sediment flux per unit width.

    The function :math:`\delta (H)` is used to indicate that water erosion will
    act on soil where it exists, and on the underlying lithology where soil is
    absent. To achieve this, :math:`\delta (H)` is defined to equal 1 when
    :math:`H > 0` (meaning soil is present), and 0 if :math:`H = 0` (meaning
    the underlying parent material is exposed).

    The weight :math:`w` promotes smoothness in the solution of erodibility at
    a given point. When the surface elevation is at the contact elevation, the
    erodibility is the average of :math:`K_1` and :math:`K_2`; above and below
    the contact, the erodibility approaches the value of :math:`K_1` and
    :math:`K_2` at a rate related to the contact zone width. Thus, to make a
    very sharp transition, use a small value for the contact zone width.

        Examples
        --------
        This is a minimal example to demonstrate how to construct an instance
        of model **BasicRtSa**. For more detailed examples, including
        steady-state test examples, see the terrainbento tutorials.

        To begin, import the model class.

        >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
        >>> from landlab.values import random, constant
        >>> from terrainbento import Clock, BasicRtSa
        >>> clock = Clock(start=0, stop=100, step=1)
        >>> grid = RasterModelGrid((5,5))
        >>> _ = random(grid, "topographic__elevation")
        >>> _ = random(grid, "soil__depth")
        >>> _ = constant(grid, "lithology_contact__elevation", value=-10.)

        Construct the model.

        >>> model = BasicRtSa(clock, grid)

        Running the model with ``model.run()`` would create output, so here we
        will just run it one step.

        >>> model.run_one_step(1.)
        >>> model.model_time

           not occur.

        3. Assesses if a :py:mod:`PrecipChanger` is an active boundary handler
           and if so, uses it to modify the erodibility by water.

        4. Updates the spatially variable erodibility value based on the
           relative distance between the topographic surface and the lithology
           contact.

        5. Calculates detachment-limited erosion by water.

        6. Calculates topographic change by linear diffusion.
