class BasicDdRt(TwoLithologyErosionModel):
    r"""**BasicDdRt** model program.

    This model program combines the :py:class:`BasicRt` and :py:class:`BasicDd`
    programs by allowing for two lithologies, an "upper" layer and a "lower"
    layer, and permitting the use of an smooth erosion threshold that increases
    with erosion depth. Given a spatially varying contact zone elevation,
    :math:`\eta_C(x,y))`, model **BasicDdRt** evolves a topographic surface
    described by :math:`\eta` with the following governing equations:

    .. math::

        \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = -\left[\omega
                         - \omega_{ct} (1 - e^{-\omega /\omega_{ct}}) \right]
                         + D\nabla^2 \eta,

        \omega = K(\eta, \eta_C) Q^{m} S^{n}

        K(\eta, \eta_C ) = w K_1 + (1 - w) K_2

        \omega_{ct}(x,y,t) = \max(\omega_c + b D_I(x,y,t)

        w = \frac{1}{1+\exp \left( -\frac{(\eta -\eta_C )}{W_c}\right)}

    where :math:`Q` is the local stream discharge, :math:`S` is the local
    slope, :math:`m` and :math:`n` are the discharge and slope exponent
    parameters, :math:`W_c` is the contact-zone width, :math:`K_1` and
    :math:`K_2` are the erodabilities of the upper and lower lithologies,
    :math:`\omega_{c}` is the in initial erosion threshold (for both
    lithologies) and :math:`b` is the rate of change of threshold with
    increasing cumulative incision :math:`D_I(x,y,t)`, and :math:`D` is the
    regolith transport parameter, :math:`w` is a weight used to calculate the
    effective erodibility :math:`K(\eta, \eta_C)` based on the depth to the
    contact zone and the width of the contact zone. :math:`\omega` is the
    erosion rate that would be calculated without the use of a threshold and as
    the threshold increases the erosion rate smoothly transitions between zero
    and :math:`\omega`.

    The weight :math:`w` promotes smoothness in the solution of erodibility at
    a given point. When the surface elevation is at the contact elevation, the
    erodibility is the average of :math:`K_1` and :math:`K_2`; above and below
    the contact, the erodibility approaches the value of :math:`K_1` and
    :math:`K_2` at a rate related to the contact zone width. Thus, to make a
    very sharp transition, use a small value for the contact zone width.

        Examples
        --------
        This is a minimal example to demonstrate how to construct an instance
        of model **BasicDdRt**. For more detailed examples, including steady-
        state steady-state test examples, see the terrainbento tutorials.

        To begin, import the model class.

        >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
        >>> from landlab.values import random, constant
        >>> from terrainbento import Clock, BasicDdRt
        >>> clock = Clock(start=0, stop=100, step=1)
        >>> grid = RasterModelGrid((5,5))
        >>> _ = random(grid, "topographic__elevation")
        >>> _ = constant(grid, "lithology_contact__elevation", value=-10.)

        Construct the model.

        >>> model = BasicDdRt(clock, grid)

        Running the model with ``model.run()`` would create output, so here we
        will just run it one step.

        The **run_one_step** method does the following:

        1. Creates rain and runoff, then directs and accumulates flow.

        2. Assesses the location, if any, of flooded nodes where erosion should
           not occur.

        3. Assesses if a :py:mod:`PrecipChanger` is an active boundary handler
           and if so, uses it to modify the erodibility by water.

        4. Updates the spatially variable erodibility value based on the
           relative distance between the topographic surface and the lithology
           contact.

        5. Updates the threshold value based on the cumulative amount of erosion
           that has occured since model run onset.

        6. Calculates detachment-limited erosion by water.

        7. Calculates topographic change by linear diffusion.
