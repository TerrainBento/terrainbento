    The derived class defines what is actually produced. This base class

    GenericOutputWriter).

    At minimum, derived classes must define **run_one_step** for generating the

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : a terrainbento ErosionModel instance

        name : string, optional
            The name of the output writer used when generating output
            filenames. Defaults to "static-interval-output-writer".

        intervals : float, int, list of floats, list of ints, optional
            A single float or int value indicates uniform intervals between
            output calls. A list of floats or ints indicates variable
            intervals between output times. Defaults to None which indicates
            that `times` will be used. If both `intervals` and `times` are
            None, will default to the producing one output at the end of the
            model run.

        intervals_repeat : bool, optional
            Indicates whether a list of intervals should repeat until the end
            of the model run. Only has effect if intervals is a list. Has no
            effect for scalar intervals (which always repeat) or if times is
            provided instead of intervals. Default is True.

        times : float, int, list of floats, list of ints, optional
            A single float or int value indicates only one output time.  A list
            of floats or ints indicates multiple predetermined output times.
            Defaults to None which indicates that `intervals` will be used. If
            both `intervals` and `times` are None, will default to the one
            output at the end of the model run. The user must ensure that the
            times implied by `times_iter` align with the model timesteps used
            by the Clock. If a timestep is skipped a warning is raised and if
            more than five timesteps are skipped an error is raised.

        generic_writer_kwargs : keyword args, optional
            Keyword arguments that will be passed directly to
            GenericOutputWriter. These include:

                * add_id : bool, defaults to True
                * save_first_timestep : bool, defaults to False
                * save_last_timestep : bool, defaults to True
                * output_dir : string, defaults to './output'
                * verbose : bool, defaults to False

            Please see :py:class:`GenericOutputWriter` for more detail.

        Returns
        -------
        StaticIntervalOutputWriter: object

        Examples
        --------
        StaticIntervalOutputWriter is a base class that should not be run by
        itself. It contains the machinery for easily creating the output times
        iterator, but does not define **run_one_step**. Please see the
        terrainbento tutorial for output examples.
