    The derived class defines when output occurs via an iterator and what is

    loop.

    At minimum, derived classes must define **run_one_step** for generating the
    actual output and must provide an iterator of output times via either the
    constructor or **register_times_iter**.  Calling
    **register_output_filepath** from the derived class allows for some

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : terrainbento ErosionModel instance

        name : string, optional
            The name of the output writer used for identifying the writer and
            generating file names. Defaults to "output-writer" or
            "output-writer-id{id}" depending on **add_id** argument.

        add_id : bool, optional
            Indicates whether the output writer ID number should be appended to
            the name using the format "-id{id}". Useful if there are
            multiple output writers of the same type with non-unique names.
            Defaults to True.

        save_first_timestep : bool, optional
            Indicates that the first output time must be at time zero
            regardless of whether or not the output time iterator generates
            zero. Defaults to False.

        save_last_timestep : bool, optional
            Indicates that the last output time must be at the clock stop time
            regardless of whether or not the output time iterator would
            normally generate the stop time. Defaults to True.

        output_dir : string, optional
            Directory where output files will be saved. Default value is None,
            which creates an 'output' directory in the current directory.

        times_iter : iterator of floats, optional
            The user can provide an iterator of floats representing output
            times here instead of registering one later using
            **register_times_iter**. The user must ensure that the times
            implied by `times_iter` align with the model timesteps used by the
            Clock. If a timestep is skipped a warning is raised and if more
            than five timesteps are skipped an error is raised.
